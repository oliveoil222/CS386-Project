_Group 10 - "Super Simple Ticketing System"\
Date and location: April 7, 2024\
Group Members: Olivia Vester, Dallon Jarman, Charles Descamps, Hannah Penado, Sam Cain, Jared Kaige_

## 1. Description
Super Simple Ticketing System is a system that allows users to manage IT tickets. Users are able to create tickets, view their tickets, call workers directly, view common knowledge tickets with predefined answers, search for tickets and change their personal settings. Users are able to log in as workers who have additional abilities, such as updating and/or closing tickets. All tickets and user data are saved in our database, and retrieved and manipulated by our middle end TicketSystem, which displays the results on the client’s end. 

## 2. Architecture

Within this diagram representing the architecture of our system, there are three main components with several subcomponents with the entire system of the Super Simple Ticketing System. The presentation layer is representative of the key components of the actual UI on our site; the pieces within represent each capability accessible on the site. By creating an issue and thus a ticket on the site, you then become a user. This connects to the business layer that records user credentials and ticket identification. This layer connects to the data layer that serves as the host for all the tracking pieces. This identifies specific clients, tickets, workers, teams, devices, and solutions and organizes them so that what goes together stays together.​ We have designed the system this way to keep it super simple like the name implies.

## 6. Design Principles
Our design follows the SOLID principles first by having all of our classes only change once per class which is The Single Responsibility Principle. Our design follows The Open-Closed Principle by using inheritance from User to RealUser and NullUser. Our Design also follows the Liskov Substitution Principle, this is shown by both RealUser and NullUser can be substituted for the User class. Our design follows the Interface Segregation Principle by creating sub-classes for all the important actors in our system. Lastly our design follows the Dependency Inversion Principle by having our classes depend on the database.
