# Deliverable 4 by Group 10

## 1. Introduction
Super Simple Ticketing System is an IT ticket tracking app for employees to efficiently manage their client’s issues, by providing a simple yet efficient method of tracking and solving issues. In our software we have the ability to sign in both admins and employees. Admins can assign tickets and employees can open, edit, or delete tickets. Users can create tickets and search for closed tickets.

## 3. Tests
The framework we used to implement our automated testing was pytest, where the test file can be found at 

https://github.com/oliveoil222/CS386-Project/tree/main/ssts/backendDB


An example of a test case was to test if our addInfo functions were actually adding info to the database. To do this we created a test function for every function within the addInfo file, that would ensure data was being added to our database collections. For each addition of a document or data into a collection, pymongo returns an acknowledgement that the data was successfully added. This meant to test that the functions were working properly, the return value of each function could not be “None” in order to know they were working properly. After combining these aspects into each function of the tests for addInfo, we were able to ensure our data was being inputted correctly into our database. The link to the test file can be found at

## 4. Adopted technologies
The technologies we have used in the development of this project can be listed and justified as followed:
MongoDB
We chose MongoDB because it was an effective way for us to organize databases for our system. We have a lot of factors that play in our systems like teams, customers, tickets, etc. so having a platform that lets us put those in place for the deployment of our system is greatly beneficial.
Google Drive
The Google Drive was chosen because it allows all group members to have access to all project documents like deliverables, meeting minutes, and graphics like UML diagrams in one location.
GitHub
This technology was a class requirement but we would have chosen it anyway; we use the GitHub repository for organizing our code, to-do tasks, and use it as a place to keep everything so that the whole group can access all the work that has been done at once.
Figma
Chosen for our frontend; this is used to create visuals for our site and also was used early in our process as a form of communication before we made a Discord server. We chose this particular platform because it was the preferred tool of our frontend team.
Flask
Flask is a system that allows for adapting Python into web applications which is exactly what we are doing. We are using this system for our middleware for the most part to connect front and back ends and make the system usable as it is deployed.
Discord
Chosen as our platform for communication; this is used for every team member to communicate their work and ask questions. We implemented a bot that informs all members of GitHub changes.
Python
Python was our language of choice for writing the non-HTML/CSS parts of our code. We chose this language because all members felt most comfortable taking on a large programming task under this language.


## 5. Learning/training
The strategies used by the team to learn the adopted technologies are a mix of things. First, everyone in the group knew how to use GitHub, Google Drive, GitHub, Discord, and Python prior to starting out on this project but we still were missing collective knowledge in MongoDB, Flask, and Figma. During the early stages of work assignment for the project, each member was tasked with finding documentation for the services they did not have knowledge of and reading it. After spending a week or two getting all caught up on how to use all of our technologies, everyone in the group felt adequately equipped to begin working on their assigned sections. Reading foundational documentation was helpful of course but as we’ve progressed throughout the project, we have continued to use references like the documentation for the technologies when we get stuck.


## 6. Deployment

## 7. Licensing
We chose to license our code under the Unlicense, effectively releasing it into the public domain, forever and always. We chose this since it is the least restrictive license that is still considered licensing code. Unlike other licensing, the Unlicense also allows for anyone to redistribute, modify, or sell the code, since it is released into the public domain. This is intentional, as with the less restrictive license, it lets anyone use the code. The license also prevents us from being held accountable for liability or providing a warranty.

## 9. Look & feel
Our product is called “Super Simple Ticketing System,” so the approach we took when designing the user interface was to keep it simple.
There is no visual clutter, the only things on the page are what the user would need to see.
![LFScreenshot One](/Deliverables/img/d4screenshotFour.png)

In order to avoid having too much on the page at once, the interface is divided into different sections which are accessible through the sidebar. These sections are distinct from each other in order to avoid confusion. This simplifies each section’s design and makes it easier to use.

## 10. Lessons learned 
During the process of this first release, the team has definitely learned that time management and communication are significant factors in having successful development of our system. We also learned that working together in person helps with working through issues a lot easier than when we are all remote from each other. It seems apparent that another factor that is beneficial to group success is making sure the goals and expectations are set and understood by each member. Moving forward and towards our second release, we aim to take all of these factors into consideration and plan out our activities more specifically to make sure every member knows exactly what needs to be done and create more strict guidelines for ourselves. Better utilization of our activity tracker could help us with this. It’s also best for us going forward to make sure in our individual teams for front, middle, and back end that we are dividing work equally to make sure nothing gets piled up on any one individual member. The actual work we are producing is going really well and we are meeting deadlines but to reduce stress and possible future mistakes, it’ll benefit all of us to organize ourselves with a little more structure.
